#  Succesfully installed 

Hi! You are seeing this page because you've just installed `Elasticsearch.Net` or `NEST` in your solution. You should only be annoyed by this popup once.

If you are upgrading from an older `NEST` version please read the [breaking changes](/breaking-changes.html) section to help you get started porting your existing code over to new `NEST` version and what has changed in elasticsearch 1.0.

If you are starting a new project and have never used `NEST` or `Elasticsearch.Net` before please see the quick start sections to get a quick overview of how to start using elasticsearch from .NET.
