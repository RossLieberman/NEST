To use the child aggregation you have to make sure 
a `_parent` mapping is in place, here we create the project
index with two mapped types, `project` and `commitactivity` and 
we add a `_parent` mapping from `commitactivity` to `parent` 

[source, csharp]

var createProjectIndex = TestClient.GetClient().CreateIndex(typeof(Project), c => c
	.Mappings(map=>map
		.Map<Project>(m=>m.AutoMap())
		.Map<CommitActivity>(m=>m
.SetParent<Project>()
		)
	)
);
