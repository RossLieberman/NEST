# Introduction

You've reached the documentation page for `Elasticsearch.Net` and `NEST`. The two official .NET clients for Elasticsearch. So why two clients I hear you say?

`Elasticsearch.Net` is a very low level, dependency free, client that has no opinions about how you build and represent your requests and responses. It has abstracted 
enough so that **all** the Elasticsearch API endpoints are represented as methods but not too much to get in the way of how you want to build your json/request/response objects. It also comes with builtin, configurable/overridable, cluster failover retry mechanisms. Elasticsearch is elastic so why not your client?

`NEST` is a high level client that has the advantage of having mapped all the request and response objects, comes with a strongly typed query DSL that maps 1 to 1 with the Elasticsearch query DSL, and takes advantage of specific .NET features such as covariant results. NEST internally uses, and still exposes, the low level `Elasticsearch.Net` client.

Please read the getting started guide for both.


## Who's using Nest
* [stackoverflow.com](http://www.stackoverflow.com) (and the rest of the stackexchange family).
* [7digital.com](http://www.7digital.com) (run NEST on mono).
* [rijksmuseum.nl](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en) (Elasticsearch is the only datastorage hit for each page).
* [Kiln](http://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/) FogCreek's version control & code review tooling. 
  They are so pleased with Elasticsearch that [they made a video about how pleased they are!](http://blog.fogcreek.com/kiln-powered-by-elasticsearch/)
