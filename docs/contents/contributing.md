# Contributing

Contributing back to `Elasticsearch.Net` and `NEST` is very much appreciated. 
Whether you [feel the need to change one character](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-net/pull/536) or have a go at 
[mapping new API's](http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-net/pull/376) no PR is too small or too big.

We do however ask you sign the [Elasticsearch CLA](http://www.elasticsearch.org/contributor-agreement/) before we can accept pull requests from you. 

# Coding styleguide

The source code uses tabs instead of spaces for indentation. 

We highly recommend the [editorconfig visual studio](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c8bccfe2-650c-4b42-bc5c-845e21f96328) extension to automatically switch to tabs and back to your preferred/default settings for other projects.

In most cases we won't shun a PR just because it uses the wrong indentation settings though it'll be **very** much appreciated!
