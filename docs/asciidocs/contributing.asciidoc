== Contributing

Contributing back to Elasticsearch.Net and NEST is very much appreciated. 
Whether you https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-net/pull/536[feel the need to change one character] or have a go at http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-net/pull/376[mapping new API's] no PR is too small or too big.

We do however ask you sign the http://www.elasticsearch.org/contributor-agreement/[Elasticsearch CLA] before we can accept pull requests from you. 

=== Coding styleguide

The source code uses tabs instead of spaces for indentation. 

We highly recommend the http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c8bccfe2-650c-4b42-bc5c-845e21f96328[editorconfig visual studio] extension to automatically switch to tabs and back to your preferred/default settings for other projects.

In most cases we won't shun a PR just because it uses the wrong indentation settings though it'll be **very** much appreciated!
